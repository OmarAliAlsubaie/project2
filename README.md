# project2
In this project, you will apply the skills you acquired in the course to gather and wrangle real-world data with two datasets of your choice.

You will retrieve and extract the data, assess the data programmatically and visually, accross elements of data quality and structure, and implement a cleaning strategy for the data. You will then store the updated data into your selected database/data store, combine the data, and answer a research question with the datasets.
